Ailec Wu - aw5fa

Background: I've taken intro to embedded systems (ECE 3430, worked with MSP430
in C), and am also currently taking ECE 4440 (Capstone, embedded systems design). I've worked a
bit with the Arduino as well (C++).

As a EE/CpE double major, I take interests in most things
electrical/electronics related (from clean room work all the way to coding
algorithms); I also enjoy learning about math -- pure or applied. Hopefully,
with this class, I'll be much more familiar and comfortable working with
embedded systems on a general level, as well as able to incorporate my
knowledge into my own personal projects.
